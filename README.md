# Snake-Game
Description
The Snake Game project is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. 
The objective of the game is to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the game's boundaries and itself.

To play the Snake Game, follow these steps:

Run the Python script.
The game window will appear with a snake and food.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
Eat the food items to increase the snake's length and score.
Avoid hitting the screen boundaries or the snake's own body.
The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or itself, and your final score is displayed.
To play again, close the game window and rerun the script.
